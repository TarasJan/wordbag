# Wordbag
Wordbag is a Desktop Daemon tool for sentence mining.

While the daemon is running in order to capture any phrase or word that you are interested in saving press Left mouse button to save it to your wordbag.

The wordbag explorer (under development) will allow you to annotate, translate and organise and revise the collected snippets in any way you would like to.

The software only currently works on Windows.
